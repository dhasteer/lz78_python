# LZ78 Sequential Probability Assignment (Python Implementation)
This code is associated with the paper [A Family of LZ78-based Universal Sequential Probability Assignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06589).

This codebase is in Python, though it is recommended to use the [Rust version of the codebase](https://github.com/NSagan271/lz78_rust) due to significant runtime speed gains. This codebase offers those curious and less familiar with Rust a more comfortable playground to tinker the implementation.

## Setup

1. (Optional) Set up and activate a virtual environment for this project.
2. Install the `lz78_python` package: `pip install --editable .`. Note that the `--editable` option allows implementation modifications to propagate to the package without having to rerun `pip install .`.

You should be all set! Refer to the `lz78_python_tutorial.ipynb` file for a tutorial on the functionalities that this Python codebase offers. It closely parallels the Rust codebase functionalities.
